    <p>
        After reviewing other professional ePortfolios, I improved my headline to make it more impactful and results-oriented. 
        I also refined my project descriptions to clearly highlight skills, purpose, and outcomes instead of only listing tasks. 
        Additionally, I enhanced the visual structure and readability of the page to create a more professional look and feel. 
        These changes made my ePortfolio more engaging, clearer, and aligned with professional standards.
